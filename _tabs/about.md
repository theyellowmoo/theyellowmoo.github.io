## 🐮 Hi! I'm the Yellow Moo - a quiet observer of how the world spins, how money flows, and how people make decisions that shape everything around them.

This blog is my personal notebook. I write to think clearly. I ask questions, not to teach, but to understand.

You’ll find here:
- Simple thoughts on economics
- Reflections on money and personal finance
- Market observations that make me pause
- Notes from reading laws and wondering what they mean

I’m not an expert. Just a curious cow, watching quietly.
